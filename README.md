Unison File Synchronizer
========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/paulp/unison.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/paulp/unison)

Unison is a file-synchronization tool for OSX, Unix, and Windows. It allows two
replicas of a collection of files and directories to be stored on different
hosts (or different disks on the same host), modified separately, and then
brought up to date by propagating the changes in each replica to the other.
